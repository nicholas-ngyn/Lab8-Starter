Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers:

Graceful degradation is a strategy where applications are built with the highest level of technology first, then progressively adjusted to work on older or less capable systems, ensuring core functionality remains available even if some advanced features do not. Service workers complement this approach by enabling offline capabilities and improving performance through caching. They intercept network requests and serve cached responses when the network is slow or unavailable, ensuring the application remains functional and responsive under varying network conditions. This synergy helps maintain a seamless user experience, regardless of the user's network situation or device capabilities.
